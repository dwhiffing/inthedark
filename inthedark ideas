  wall eggs- glow in the dark, if they get too big, they hatch, use flash light to keep them frow growing
  light haters- if you get the light on them, they charge at you, otherwise they avoid you
  doppelgangers - stays behind player unles they back into a wall, subtle hints that its behind you
  blenders- blends into bg, if you get too close, they take you out, they are more obvious if the light is directly on them
  swarmers- when they see your light, they all swarm towards you, you have to bathe in darkness for them to disperse



player finds flashlight and batteries and flares
  lamp gives them a small aura

uses flash light to push back enemies

eggs hatch into different enemy types based on how you interact with them

player has no life, but drops equipment when attacked
  first flares, then the flashlight, then the lamp

once you have no equipment, you have only a bit of time to find it before you die
