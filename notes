Map generation rules
  start with a 4 way in the center
  4 major paths which split at a random point
    eg path may split on first tile or 2nd, or 8th,
    each path sould be about 9 tiles long

    tiles:

      each of these types has several shape variations, but their boundries are the exact same
    most tiles should be
    most tiles should be 1s and 2s, but a predetermined split will be placed in each path
    have a target length for each path and when target length is met, end path


  process:

    place 4 in center
    start with north, if there is no tile, place the next tile
    get next tile


  things
    grid: 2d array
      size:
      center:
      get tile at
      get neighbour of
      get neighbours of
      get center tile

    tile: individual tile
      type:
        each tile has a type, which represents how many exits it has
        null - empty space
        0 - one exit
        1 - two exits, one north, one east
        2 - two exits one north one south
        3 - 3 exits, no exit south
        4 - 4 exits
      rotation: the orientation of the tile
        0: always connects south
        1: always conencts west
        2: always connects east
        3: always connects north

      shape: what variation of the tile shape
      isBlocked:
        whether a is placed validly, ie all its paths are either connected or connected to blank spaces

    generator: manages placing of tiles

place tile of type 4 in center
do
  get first open path
  do

    get first open path on tile
    get new tile

    if target length is met
      get tile of type 0
    if at split point
      get tile of type 3
    else
      get tile of type 1

    do

      get direction of open path and rotate tile to connect to that

    while tile not blocked

    commit tile placement

  while path not complete

while there are open roads remaining
